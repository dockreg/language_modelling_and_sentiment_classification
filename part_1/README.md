## CA4023 Part 1 - Sentence Boundary Detection

Part 1 of this assignment involves detecting the sentence boundary for a selected corpus without using any NLP ML libraries. For this task python and regex is used. The code is tested using the `test.txt` file and the output can be found in the `output.txt` file. 

#### Running the code

To run this code:

```
git clone https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/dockreg2/ca4023_assignment_1.git
cd part_1
python3 sentence_boundary_detection.py
```

Successful output will be indicated by the following message:

'Test.txt has been processed and the sentences have been put line by line into output.txt'

This solution is limited by the use cases and is trained the test.txt file. It therefore may not catch all potential use cases but provides a strong starting point for sentence boundary detection.
