# CA4023_Assignment_1

Sentence boundary detection, language modelling, and Na√Øve Bayes sentiment polarity classifier.

## Part 1

Part 1 of this assignment is creating a sentence boundary detector without using any available NLP ML libraries. This is done using python 3 and regex

## Part 2

Part 2 involves creating an unsmoothed bigram language model to calculate probabilities for a test data set having created the model and trained it on a training data set. This model uses log probabilities.

## Part 3

Part 3 is the creation of a naive bayes sentiment polarity classfier to determine the sentiment of 200 movie reviews. This model uses log likelihoods, add one smoothing and is trained on 1800 movie reviews.
