boy  what a great movie   keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together  the director of the fugitive  andrew davis  back again to give us another thriller  and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot  how could this not be a blockbuster  all diehard keanu reeves fans  read on  ol  much ado about nothing  plays eddie kasalivich  a machinist studying at the university of chicago  to help pay for the rent  he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university  by happy coincidence  he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics  this project holds great promise  taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in  a potential solution to the earths energy problems without the pollution cost  surely nobody could have any problems with that  morgan freeman is paul shannon  the projects sponsor  he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public  he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly  so he murders the project leader  blows up the project  great but short scene here  sort of like a mini id4 citydevastation thing  and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hitech hushhush location  unfortunately  our intrepid machinist and an english physicist  weisz  manage to get away and now follows a fugitivelike chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script  this movie is just dying for a comparison with  the fugitive   both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesnt change much  i guess we cant really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere  the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones  chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward  credit to them  but we arent really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters  where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy  eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves character is never given the time to develop  it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences  which frankly  get quite boring after a while  harrison ford was  the man against the world   he was alone in a world where he didnt know who to trust and it came across real well  in chain reaction  keanu reeves isnt alone  now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia  vulnerability and confusion  we dont get this  we get him thinking hes still in speed  only now our sandra bullock has an english accent  probably doesnt drive a bus  and hardly contributes anything to the movie  the producers here probably thought   hey  what if keanu and rachel dont hit it off too well  lets rope in that morgan to help us out   well  keanu and rachel didnt hit it off well on the screen  and most unfortunately  morgan freeman doesnt help much either  the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder  its not really his fault  once again  andrew davis just doesnt take the time to build his characters  someone must have convinced him that this time round  cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken  the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv2 broadcast     a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha      pretty good  bring a friend       amazing  potent stuff        perfection  see it twice

the idea at the center of the devils advocate  which is  thus far  one of the three or four best films of 1997  is that no matter what decision is made  evil will triumph  god is a trickster  satan is a humanist   the last humanist   he appears in many guises  and seduces many men and women  in his own words   vanity  by far my favorite sin   al pacino plays this role with relish  and gets to chew some delectable lines   lemme givya a piece o inside wisdom on god       i have a million names       as john milton  the devil  the main idea  that he can appear as anyone  in any form  in this case  a buisness man   harkens mainly back to terry gilliams the time bandits  but the film  is something else  something original  part of what makes it so very good  is that it never takes itself too seriously  it dabbles with morality  vanity  death  and child abuse  but doesnt try to become any profound study of power  this is a marvelous confection  cocky  funny  thought provoking  it is also entertaining  there is no way you could possibly predict the ending  it pulls back upon itself  drawing purely out of the minds eye  the final shot is more creative  more daring  more challenging  then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coens fargo  the central themes are fascinating  sometimes reminiscent of james the turn of the screw  and oates accursed inhabitants of the house of bly   and the product that is built around it really wows  its nice to know that things like this are still being made

  alcohol and drugs  bad  not alcohol and drugs  good  got it   just when you though youve seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen  be that insanity or alcoholism  hollywood releases yet another one of those deep  emotional stories about finding yourself   28 days is practically a visualization of the usual meaningful true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aameetings  gwennie  sandra bullock  is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol  for her life was a big party  with no beginning and no end  this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself  her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes  such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper  dominic west   borrowed her sisters  elizabeth perkins  wedding limo and crashed it into someones house  this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in courtordered rehab  here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption  willpower and commitment  most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party  the film itself feels like a rehab program  whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times  it is a classic cautionary tale  an echo  a big  fat and expensive clich   a shadow of last years girl  interrupted  which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like the cuckoos nest and trainspotting  director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors  that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review  for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a dramacomedy  jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues  alienation  despair  terror  confusion  loneliness  and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean  isnt that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place  even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park  betty thomas idea of hell is a cozy  homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke  drink or watch tv after 11  it is simply too light  simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously  but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance  that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story    all you need to do is just say no   says dr  cornell  steve buscemi  as if was the revelation of the century  and thats how simple it is  in fact i would rather watch lost in space once again  than return to 28 days  as for acting  its acceptable  but hardly anything else  for sandra bullock its an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than speed  she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop  dominic west shines as the source of gwenies devilish temptations  but elizabeth perkins and steve buscemis great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters  although intellectually girl  interrupted was a greater achievement  28 days is superior in its visual aspect  there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing  but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor  the most important thing is that weve seen it before and it was a lot better  clean and sober  only when i laugh  when a man loves a woman  leaving las vegas and many other stronger films were made about the same issues  so whats the point  in other words 28 days doesnt contribute to the moviemaking business on any level  if youre caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and youre standing in front of the movie theatre  you might as well go in and watch 28 days  under all other circumstances stay away  because this film equals 8 and 103 minutes lost

### Review: 
synopsis  cromagnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion  reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggystyle  ayla grows up to become a blond  feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate  comments  allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies  she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the scifi classic blade runner  the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point  the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title  not even her starring role in this turkey  unfortunately  can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese  its so uniquely bad  a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries  and miserably fails  to be serious  that its oddly fascinating  the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed  wanting to see how this dud plays out  the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m  auel  to this day  the book possesses a loyal cult following  i remember a dear friend of mine had a dogeared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the socalled dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother  i have never read this book  but i sure hope its 10  000 times better than its film adaptation  if not  then im at a complete loss to explain its popularity  the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene  a young ayla  looking much like drew barrymore in e  t   tramps about in the woods  with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her  the audiences expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered  what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up aylas mother  a blonde with fur pants    er  leggings   tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera    well  as the earthquake slowly recedes  a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch  but the screaming sixyearold manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven  i wont detail the story any further  this seems enough to illustrate my point  this movie is really stupid  it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief  also  the obvious comparison between the appearance of cromagnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston  the movie doesnt just suggest this message  it whacks the message into the audience with a twobyfour  a blond  gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs  shes of the  new people   theyre of the  old people  with  the memories   yep  we get it  we get it  the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best makeup  which surprises me  the movie depends upon a lot of makeup obviously  but much of it is unconvincing  as stated before  daryl hannah is daryl hannah here  she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time  the rest of the characters have dark makeup of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt  the facepainting thats occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind  this movie also suffers from its new age trappings  maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985  but now it sounds dated and cliched  like poorly conceived elevator music  add to this the films fauxmysticism  including spirit animals and dream visions  and a narrator who sounds like a psychic youd expect to hear on a 1900 number  and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious  the clan of the cave bear is rated r  though its probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films ive seen in quite a while  it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity  the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes  the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear  the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about  although this may sound gratuitous  im sure  its so cheesy that it probably wont bother most people  the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie  however  as i wrote at the beginning of this review  it does have the distinction of originality  typically when i think of bottomofthebarrel films dealing with early man  fantasy movies involving dinosaurs  who did not exist at the same time as man  and raquel welch come to mind  the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that  though its so bad  the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie  which is why i awarded this turkey two stars   i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version  however  im only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie  i shudder to think that it could be otherwise

the film may be called mercury rising  but that title doesnt describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture  a routine thriller that combines government coverups with a cloying and poorlymotivated buddy story  the  hook  that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic  however  aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance  this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device  those expecting to see even a semithorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed  mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism  the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard toswallow  i dont know whether the problem is in the original book  simple simon  or in the screenplay adaptation  but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible  once again  certain standby plot elements  the highlevel government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent  are recycled  and not to good effect  while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood  this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense  the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold  art jeffries  bruce willis   is confronted with his own failure  unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time  he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death  the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavyhandedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9year old simon lynch  miko hughes  when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player  soon  art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone  fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time  with the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player always just a step behind them  along the way  they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy  chi mcbride  and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest  kim dickens   why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player  apparently  the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultrasecret code called  mercury   to make sure it cant be cracked  they do the most intuitive thing possible  place a sample of it in a  nerds puzzle magazine   of course  no one can solve it  no one except autistic simon  that is  when he calls the phone number listed in the solution  he gets the nsa  as a result  the coldhearted  sneering government man  alec baldwin  decides that simon has to be eliminated  for the good of the country  of course  but he hasnt counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold  even though everyone in the audience has  its hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesnt do anything exceptionally well  and does quite a few things rather poorly  for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like  mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from timetotime  but even the most exciting scenes  such as the one where art and simon are crouched down  avoiding passing trains  arent that pulsepounding  the climactic struggle is a real hohum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness  overall  director harold becker is constantly struggling  and failing  to generate even a moment that isnt derivative or obligatory  bruce willis star seems to be fading  this is his fourth straight lackluster outing  following last man standing  the fifth element  and the jackal  willis isnt terrible  but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through  and often does  alec baldwin  combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice  does some scenery chewing  but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace  the films real star is young miko hughes  heather langenkamps son in wes cravens new nightmare   who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual  but is about 50 years younger  mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain  the replacement killers  and u  s  marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers  for those who like action and adventure in the theater  this has not been a good year  hopefully  the advent of summer will change that  until then  the best choices  for bruce willis or any other action hero  are on video  and  if youre determined to see mercury rising  check out the morning sky in early may

  when you get out of jail  you can kill him   starring ashley judd  tommy lee jones  bruce greenwood  rated r  double jeopardy is a lurid  prepostrous thriller thats also one of the years most enjoyable  its an uncompromisingly brutal  cheerfully anarchic  hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it  there is not a moment here when the events on screen dont have a direct bearing on the plot  once the film gets going it never stops  it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and thats probably a correct assessment of the plot  but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davisharrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones  not even bothering with character introduction  director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the getgo and never finds the brake  we meet  rather hastily  libby and nick parsons  ashley judd and bruce greenwood  respectively  a seemingly happy married couple  with a son matty  age 4  they go out on a sailboat one night  and after a period of some rockin sex  they go to sleep  libby hears a strange noise  wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood  she follows a red trail to the upper deck  where she finds a knife and  out of astonishment  picks it up  at that convenient moment  the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested  her lawyer  a friend  puts up a defense in court  but though we know she is innocent  the evidence against her is too compelling  her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison  once in prison  she makes a phone call to her friend  her friend gives her son the phone  nick walks in the room  little matty screams  daddy   the phone goes dead  libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isnt even dead  she gets some advice from a prisonerformer lawyer  who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband  they cant convict her of the same crime again  meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they cant touch her  after a weirdly short amount of time  she gets out of parole  she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees  under the command of parole officer travis lehman  tommy lee jones   she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back  which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated  she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her sons  adopter   double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false  the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime  same time  same place  same circumstances  its not like it matters  this is a rollickingly good thriller  intense  exciting  fast and furious  its silly alright  but this is the kind of film you just dont question  in some films  plausibility is everything  double jeopardy  however  is not concerned with making sense  its sole purpose is to entertain  and it does  judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role  this is her breakout boxoffice performance  and she is terrific  she brings some emotion to what could have been a onedimensional role  giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces  tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive  but the movie makes good use of his stonefaced wit  thankfully  too  double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis  a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the films story  this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys  and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that  the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful  as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book  after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops  deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system  its great to see a movie that doesnt so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure  double jeopardy is really good  but it isnt the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards  its one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off  otherwise  your brain will be busy ruining your experience  this is a thriller that isnt concerned with being smart or plausible  instead it diverts all attention to the action  which  this year  is second to none

gere  willis  poitier chase each other around the world the jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman when the soviet union imploded  the western countries lost their shadow  with the united states friendly with the russians  we no longer had an entity to blame for the worlds problems  this showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy  its time to rejoice because weve found our new villain  now its no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands  its the russian _mafia_  a perfect solution  it combines the dread of organized crime and the stillpresent uneasiness with the former eastern block countries  best of all  the villains are still foreigners  fear of the other always plays best  so it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal  bruce willis  to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid  the fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone theyre not sure even exists  coming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen  richard gere  who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston  sidney poitier  and russian major valentina koslova  diane venora   mulqueens exgirlfriend basque terrorist isabella  mathilda may  is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal    presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met   the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his 70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesnt slip away  crossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his minivan  the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers  being very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller  the day of the jackal   comparison between the two films is inevitable  there is no doubt that the original is the better movie  playing the story for suspense rather than the current actionadventure  as a mystery   the jackal  has enough holes in it to ruin the tale  but if you can accept it for what it is  theres entertainment to be had  holes  lets see  a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up  for a 20year veteran that can command the big bucks  the jackal is an incredibly poor shot  the final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police  but its just the two of them  willis disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmers in  the saint     and lest you misunderstand  thats not a compliment   but the three stars are fun to watch  its good to see gere in something other than a business suit  willis has a mixed history in picking projects  but his characters are always watchable  poitier is by far the superior actor  but has limited screen time  the problems in logic are flaws  but dont ruin the experience  occasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes  this is one of them  the appeared in the 112097  bloomington voice   bloomington  indiana

plot  a dude and his brother are driving crosscountry and decide to fool around with a trucker on their cb radio  it isnt long before their little prank gets someone put into a coma  long story  and the next thing you know  the trucker is following them too  lotsa nuttiness ensues and then  they pick up their other friend  venna  a girl who the dude has a crush on  but whats this     the trucker is still on their tail and is now harassing all three of the young whippersnappers     you bet  buckle up  dorothy    this is gonna be one bumpy ride  critique  a good ol time at the movies  heres a film that actually gives away most of its plotline in its trailer and doesnt really bring anything  new  to the forefront  if youve seen flicks like duel and breakdown  youve crossed this path before   but still manages to entertain you gangbusters  with realistic situations  believable characters  funny moments  thrills  chills  the whole shebang  lets give it up for director john dahl  who continues to put out solid films every other year  if you havent seen red rock west  do yourself a favor right now  and jot it down on a piece of paper and rent it at your earliest convenience   and much like that film  this one has an excellent premise and sets everything up at an even pace  it gives you a little bit of background on each of the main three characters  and then shows you how one small prank  can lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone  paul walker really surprised me in this movie  since ive never much thought of him as anything more than a pretty face  and damn  is it ever pretty or what    but here  he actually manages to put some depth behind the looks and thats always appreciated in films in which you are so closely tied to the main characters  sobieski is also good  but she isnt in the movie for as long as youd think  but the man who really takes this film to another level  is steve zahn  if youve loved this guy as the  goofball  in most of his previous roles  youll appreciate him even more here  as the dude who starts off as one of the most manic and excited human beings ive seen in quite some time   this is so awesome      only to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of the flick  and speaking of the ending  boy  does this movie deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or what    the arrow and i were practically in each others arms  well  maybe im exaggerating  but you catch my drift  as each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn  took it all to an even higher level  once again  kudos to director dahl for being able to generate that type of intensity  suspense and tension  with a great score  editing  style and camerawork  plotwise  i too did wonder how the  bad guy  was able to track them so well  but it didnt really bother me all that much  you can assume that he had bugged their car    but pretty much everything else in the story stuck like glue and i couldnt help but put myself in their shoes and appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance  a great movie with an even cooler ending  this film will likely be remembered as one of the better thrillers of the year    this is amazing     wheres joblo coming from  american psycho  1010   deep blue sea  810   eye of the beholder  410   the fast and the furious  710   final destination  810   the glass house  610   no way out  810

for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend  there are certain rules that he needs to follow  firstly  fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship  secondly  buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes  thirdly  find the perfect moment and location to propose  finally  the groomwannabe should probably get her parents blessing  of these four  the last one can be a nightmare  meeting parents is a rite of passage  fraught with unexpected questions  bouts of nervousness  the reality of being disliked  and the inability to make a positive impression  if youre lucky  things will go smoothly  but  if youre greg focker  ben stiller   everything will go wrong  and with a name like that  how could it not  when greg first meets his fianc  es father  jack byrnes  the grimacing robert deniro   greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive  when he tells jack that hes a male nurse  the incorrigible dad shoots back   not many men in your profession  huh  greg   its definitely not a good start  but greg is determined to win him over  and its this desire that fuels the movie  he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner  it doesnt matter that hes jewish  if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace  then thats what hes going to gamely do    oh god    youre such a good god   he moons  his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle  but when jack gives him the  deniro squint   that familiar  unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility   its pretty hard not to grin  things get progressively worse for greg  and thats too bad because hes a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart  eventually  he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up  committing a host of gaffes that embarrass  humiliate or injure other people  its a neverending ordeal of missteps  miscues  and mistakes  he buys some champagne  but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances  he tries to find jacks missing cat  but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble  and there are several other episodes  each one trumping the next in outrageousness  the more our wellmeaning beau screwed up  the more the audience groaned in sympathy  we liked greg  and  we liked this movie    meet the parents  is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments  just sit back and watch greg get into trouble  no matter what the situation  whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house  things will horribly go wrong  we laugh at gregs expense  but love often makes a person do dumb things  and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool  deniro is also affable  tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside  their tugofwar is often funny  the slapstick is elaborate  and there are several topical throwaway gags  mostly targeted at the airline industry  to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future inlaws from hell

if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films its their predictable endings  the devils advocate has the atypical hollywood ending  when everything that should happen does  unfortunately for the devils advocate  this ending nearly collapses in on itself  and ruins the entire film  nevertheless  the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment  note to self  kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film   i dont think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan  well  it does contain this element  but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements  and seemingly more interesting ones at that   the devils advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session  kevin lomax  keanu reeves  is the defense attorney  working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl  he ends up with a notguilty verdict  despite an emotional testimony from the victim  heather matarazzo   he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann  charlize theron  where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury  he accepts  mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive  and he flies to new york with his wife  after proving his worth for selecting juries  and his perfect winning streak in court   the head of the firm  john milton  al pacino   asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer  he graciously accepts  where he is treated almost as a god  he is given an incredible apartment  which is bigger than my entire house now   and a hefty paycheck  his life seems to be on the rise  and of course  his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline  he is attracted to fellow employee christabella  connie nielson   and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment  mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice  especially if it is not wanted  meanwhile  kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen  craig t  nelson  who apparently murdered three people  he spends hours upon hours with this case  while forgetting his loving wife  who may or may not be going insane  all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself  after a while  things turn completely upsidedown  as kevins wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends  a fellow employee is murdered in the park  and his mother  judith ivey  reveals information about kevins real father  is it all just a big nightmare  or is john milton really satan  playing tricks with kevins life  the devils advocate plays out fairly straightforward  but for some odd reason  the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we dont expect  is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed  if so  the devils advocate messes up completely  and ironically  i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now  than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early  i went into the devils advocate expecting a shocking horror film  and that is exactly what i got  i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally  and that is what i got  but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending  did i mention that i didnt like the ending    the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending  they pull the rug out from under you  films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected  more or less  we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way  the devils advocate  on the other hand  ends unpredictably  not from us knowing a lot  but knowing nothing at all  if that is confusing  i recommend watching the film  and then reading that again  as for the film overall  i enjoyed the entire first two hours  being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study  the film runs like a wellbuilt clock  slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax  and an unpredictable one at that   and then you settle in for a nice resolution  which does not occur  it was at this point that i felt cheated  taking us on a terror ride of intrigue  we follow kevin lomax around  as he is the centerpiece of the film  everything occurs from his perspective  he is our representation on screen  sort of   but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game  i dont want to spoil the ending  so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself  perhaps the most shocking thing about the devils advocate is the extreme amount of everything  it earned its r rating for a reason  there is plenty of nudity  sex  violence  gore  and then you have gore  violence  sex  and more nudity  this film really isnt subtle about anything  showing us everything  it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc17 rating  as it is quite harsh  however  the movie does have its merits  and nudity and sex are among those  i dont condone sex and nudity in films  but if its there  i might as well enjoy it  the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch  the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining  but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife  mary ann  portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron  mary anns problems are incredibly intense  and i found myself wanting to witness her decline  this may sound uncaring  but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her  she is the most interesting character on the screen  who is forced into a world where she is not wanted  something the devils advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity  especially for a film of this nature  the story actually has something to say about humanity  in one of the last scenes  john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children  he is satan  of course   he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity  then  god sets up rules which contradict human nature  this semireligious bashing is more humorous than frightening  what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud  partially thinking it was funny  but patially realizing it was true  these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devils advocate  giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing  but im sure they came straight from the novel it was based on   when a film has something to say about our society  it deserves to be watched  the cast of the devils advocate is one of the highlights  as we see memorable faces  and they put spins on those memorable faces we dont expect  heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case  and she does a great job  probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves  he has proven himself an uneven actor  successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic   but he tops himself with this performance  i have never seen him more believable to date  al pacino is of course the scene stealer  his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson  the witches of eastwick  and max von sydow  needful things   he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes  but he remains completely believable  if that is the correct term   jeffrey jones  mostly known as the principal in ferris buellers day off  also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon  judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevins past  connie nielson is very effective in her role  and she also appears naked several times  one familiar face with a twist was  coach  star  craig t  nelson  who gives a very good performance  the devils advocate is rated r for sexuality  nudity  violence  language  and some gore  at 144 minutes  this film moves along fairly quickly  for the first two hours  i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters  the technical quality is also remarkable  with great special effects and a good musical score  director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture  only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes  i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film  and hackford gave me just that for a long time  but just before the end  he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream  personally  i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early
